  <p class="basictext">
 
Volleyball is a team based sport played by 2 teams eithe side of a net. The game started in Ameirca and is now becomeing as popular there as it is worldwide. Millions play the game at least once a week. The rules of the game are that each team must hit the ball over the next regualry and prevent the ball from hitting the ground. A team is only allowed to hit the ball twice in thier own side of the court and, a single player can't hit the ball more than once. If the ball falls in one side of the court the oposing side scores a point, unless its the other teams fault.
<br> <br>
The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise. 
The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).
